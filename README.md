# DataEngineerProject-Olypmics
Overview - 

In this project, we retrieve raw data from an API using Azure Data Factory and store it in Azure Data Lake Storage. Then, with Azure Databricks, we write Spark code to refine the raw data. This involves various transformations such as filtering and aggregating. Once the data is transformed, we load it back into Azure Data Lake Storage. This process ensures that the data is organized and ready for analysis, enabling informed decision-making and insights within the organization.
